## Creation of Entangled States

Entangled states are typically created when two or more particles interact in a way that their quantum states become intertwined or correlated. This can occur through processes such as [particle decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay), photon emission, or interactions within a controlled quantum system.

For example, in the process of [spontaneous parametric down-conversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spontaneous_parametric_down-conversion), a single photon can be split into two entangled photons with opposite polarizations.

## Correlation of Properties

Once entangled, the properties of the particles become correlated in a way that the state of one particle is dependent on the state of the other(s), and vice versa. This correlation is often stronger than any classical correlation and cannot be explained by classical physics.

Entangled particles exhibit correlations in various properties, such as [spin](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin), polarization, position, and momentum.

## EPR Paradox

Entanglement was famously discussed in the context of the [Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein%E2%80%93Podolsky%E2%80%93Rosen_paradox), proposed by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky, and Nathan Rosen in 1935. The EPR paradox highlighted the peculiar consequences of quantum entanglement, including the non-locality of quantum mechanics.

According to the EPR argument, if two particles are entangled and separated by a large distance, measuring the state of one particle instantaneously determines the state of the other, regardless of the distance between them. This seemingly instantaneous communication violates classical notions of locality and causality.

## Applications

Entanglement has profound implications for various areas of quantum technology, including [quantum computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_computing), [quantum cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_cryptography), and [quantum teleportation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_teleportation).

In quantum computing, entanglement enables the creation of quantum gates and circuits that operate on multiple qubits simultaneously, leading to exponential speedups for certain computational tasks.

In quantum cryptography, entanglement is used to establish secure communication channels by detecting eavesdropping attempts through the violation of entanglement-based inequalities.
In quantum teleportation, entanglement enables the transfer of quantum information from one location to another without physically transporting the particles themselves.
