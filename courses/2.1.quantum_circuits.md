Quantum circuits are a graphical representation of quantum algorithms and computations. They consist of quantum gates, which are unitary operators that operate on qubits. Quantum circuits are analogous to classical circuits, but instead of manipulating classical bits, they manipulate quantum bits or qubits.

## Quantum Gates

Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits. They are unitary operators that act on one or more qubits to perform specific quantum operations, such as changing the state of a qubit or creating entanglement between qubits.

Examples of common quantum gates:
  
Hadamard gate (H): Creates superposition by transforming the basis states $|0⟩$ and $|1⟩$ into equal superpositions of themselves.

Pauli gates (X, Y, Z): Perform rotations around the X, Y, and Z axes of the [Bloch sphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloch_sphere), respectively.

CNOT gate: Controlled-NOT gate, which performs a NOT operation on the target qubit if the control qubit is in state $|1⟩$.

Quantum gates are represented graphically as symbols, similar to classical gates in classical circuits.

## Quantum Circuit Diagrams

Quantum circuits are depicted graphically using circuit diagrams composed of horizontal lines (wires) representing qubits and symbols representing quantum gates applied to those qubits.

The quantum gates are applied sequentially to the qubits, with each gate operation represented as a box or symbol connected to the corresponding qubit wire.

The circuit diagram flows from left to right, with gates applied from left to right in chronological order.

## Measurement

Quantum circuits often include measurement operations, which collapse the quantum state of one or more qubits into classical states (0 or 1) with certain probabilities.

Measurement operations are represented by the symbol $M$ or $|\psi\rangle$ followed by a double line, indicating the classical output of the measurement.

## Execution

Quantum circuits represent sequences of quantum operations that transform an initial input state into a final output state. The execution of a quantum circuit involves applying the quantum gates in the circuit sequentially to the input qubits, resulting in a final quantum state.

The final quantum state can then be measured to obtain classical outcomes or used as input for subsequent quantum computations.

Overall, quantum circuits provide a systematic and visual way to represent and analyze quantum algorithms and computations, enabling researchers and practitioners to design, simulate, and execute quantum algorithms on quantum computers.
