# Quantum

This repository is an educational workspace focused on quantum computing. It gathers algorithms I've re-implemented to comprehend this field using Qiskit with python3.

It also contains [courses](courses/0.0.intro.md), a collection of documents I've written to memorize information gathered during my journey. It could be helpful to anyone interested in the subject.
